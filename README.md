# Variable-banner-length (Python) 
my solution to the variable banner length challenge found on here http://usingpython.com/python-programming-challenges/ 
What I learned by doing this challenge:
1. How to implement iteration with python
2. How to gather a string from user input
3. How to count the number of letters in a string (also found out that it can be done using len(<string>) )
4. How to add comments into .py programs.
